Adam's Great Grandma, Erna Beckmeyer, died on New Years Eve, concluding
a year that I've realized the pain of new life and the pain of death. I
see why most writers who write about this are poets rather than
prosists, because I sure don't know where to start. The paradoxical joy
I feel when I see Job grin and giggle at his Great Great Grandma in her
casket reminds me not just that life goes on here on earth, but that our futures can't
be bound by this world.

Ringing in the New Year, I know there's so much more adventure to be
had.
