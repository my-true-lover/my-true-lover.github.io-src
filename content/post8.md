Gallery: The Surprise of Ghent

On Saturday, we took a train to Bruges. Or rather, we took a train part
of the way to Bruges. Fun fact about Belgium, there is both a Ghent -
Saint Peters train stop, and a Bruges - Saint Peters train stop, and the
intercity train from Brussels stops at both of them. So we accidentally
spent the day in Ghent instead of Bruges, and it was a pleasant
surprise!

Ghent has a delightful history of sheep and rebellion, and Adam and I
loved St Bavo's Abbey. We also went inside St Michaels Church, but it
was a bit too catholic for our tastes. We ate lunch at a cute
Mediterranean place with awkward stairs and spent the afternoon touring
the Castle of the Counts (a.k.a. Gravensteen), which was built
throughout the 11th-12th centuries. While much of the castles history
was gruesome and dissappointing, it was *way cool* to see and imagine how
that lovely view looked back in the day.

After we had left the castle with exhausted feet, we went on to try the
"famous noses of Ghent" we kept hearing about being sold in food carts
next to waffle stands (waffle stands being basically the Belgium city
equivalent of hot dog stands in American cities; if anyone is wondering why
Belgium is more fun to visit than America, I suggest that pouring dark
chocolate onto a cake in the shape of a waffle and making them available
on every street corner would make even a boring place lovely to visit,
and America should try it). So we buy 100g of these 'noses' which I
assume are chocolate, because so far in my experience of Belgium,
everything being sold to tourists falls into the category of 1. awesome
old building 2. local beer 3. chocolate. Since the noses are edible and
not liquid, I still feel justified in my assumption that it was
chocolate.

It wasn't chocolate. I bit into my cone shaped delicacy only to find
that it was approximately a melted grape gummy bear covered in wax. So
of course, I didn't say anything immediately, I just stuck the rest of
the cone in Adam's mouth so he could continue to enjoy the surprise of
Ghent as much as I did.
