According to Martin Luther, the word priest should be as common as the word christian. According to the Bible, if we are a part of God's kingdom under the new covenant, we are priests. 

Now you're either thinking what's all this about covenants and kingdoms? Or you're thinking yeah, but I'm not going to go around introducing myself as God's priest. My response to either of you? Read the Bible. I think our lives would be a lot simpler if ~~Christians~~ priests spoke using Biblical language instead of having to constantly translate between Biblical language and Christianese and English. Churches should have ~~pastors~~ elders, teach ~~good theology~~ sound doctrine, and practice ~~the sacraments~~ doing what Jesus told us to do. I think if we use Biblical language, we can more easily deflect attacks on sound doctrine because we can interpret our own words by the light of Scripture instead of pretending that works of satisfaction (the part of Catholic confession that most crucially sets reformed faith apart from Catholicism) are a part of trusting Christ for salvation.

Happy Reformation Day from your locally exiled, undeserving priestess!(1 Peter 2)
