I don't know how to quantify struggle, how to know when to say, "It's too much." I don't know how to communicate when I'm running out of patience and frantically praying for more. If I come right out and say it, or even ask for help, the patience would disappear like a breaking dam and I'd be screaming at you, screaming and destroying our carefully built relationship like godzilla incensed.

So what do I do? Cry and beg for your forgiveness. Wait for you to push me over the edge until I'd rather blow my brains out than look at you for a second but I want to swear that doesn't mean I love you less even when I know you'd think otherwise so I hold it all in, turning me raw, turning me hard, turning my heart into an unrecognizable mess. If everything else bled away one day, would you be able to identify me in a morgue from merely the remains of my heart? Would it beat again without a body if you touched it, like a Grimm Sleeping Beauty or was Sleeping Beauty grim all along?

I think it would beat if you touched it, no matter how long it took for you to soften and pull on your snow boots in the middle of the night, to sled down to where I've caved and hike me back up to where we built our city with one house still standing because that's the way it is at night, just our one house in the middle of nowhere and it won't be a home in a neighborhood until the sun wakes the veins connecting us up.

How do I quantify struggle in the morning, when God's clothing covers the rawness and I know how to heal?
