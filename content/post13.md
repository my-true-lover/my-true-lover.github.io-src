Once upon a time, things were tough. There was sickness; sickness of all sorts, everywhere. We toiled and hoped for better days. We loved each other but our selfishness got in the way.

I'm sure you can relate.

Thank God that He has saved us, and our hope is never in vain.

I had Hand, Foot, and Mouth last week, and Job has it this week. It sucks. But I'm super thankful for a loving husband and father to Job who has been patiently taking care of us and buying us ice cream. I miss our small group and church family and generally being part of the rest of the world. I feel like a contagious monster who can't be let out; it's driving me a bit crazy. We even had new neighbors move in but I haven't brought them cookies or introduced myself because I know giving them a disease is a bad form of hospitality. I feel like there's a hashtag here somewhere, but I'm too uncouth to figure it out.
