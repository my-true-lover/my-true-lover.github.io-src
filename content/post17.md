Recently, we've had some house problems. One Sunday Adam had to stay home to fix the flooding in the basement while Job and I went to church. I guess I looked around a bit more than I usually do, because I realized I know less than 50% of my church, probably less than 25% that I actually know beyond their first name. I'm desperate to live life with the people around me, but I don't know how to break down the barriers of busyness of even make the best of the time we do spend together. How can I be desperate for something I'm totally not good at? How am I failing so terribly?

There's a lesson I learned from a family that discipled Adam and I at our last church, something I've utilized since moving here.

Community Building Lesson 1: Cast a wide net and reel in the willing.

And by that I mean: invite people over for dinner. Anyone at our church. It's painfully obvious, yet I only thought of it through imitating a family much wiser than us.

To be honest, sometimes I'm much too focused on my own feelings and my own self-pity, I don't focus on my own time-stewardship, which is really what my day-to-day life is about. What actions am I taking? How am I spending my time? Is my time working good for those around me, especially my family, especially my church family? Life doesn't look exactly how I want it to, but I'm trying and I'm thankful that my family (church family included) is trying, too. Maybe by next year I'll get up to 60%.
