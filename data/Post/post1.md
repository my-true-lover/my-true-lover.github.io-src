Today was one of *those* days. My dog pooped all over the nursery, my computer
shut down, my to do list got lost, and I fell apart and got basically nothing
done. I spent the majority of my day crying out to God and googling how to fight
depression during pregnancy (the best answer was by John Piper and not specific
to pregnancy: singing—specifically the Psalms). 

And Psalm 31 did save my butt today. But my day didn’t get better until my
husband came home. He walked in the door and I started venting and raging to
explain how terrible my day was, and in his wisdom he told me to stop and calm
down and would I like to cuddle on the couch?

So with my face squished against his pectorals, he asks me why I’m still sad. I
tell him it’s hard not to cry and he gives me permission, because he knows that
somehow, when my tears soak into his shirt, their sadness disappears and is
replaced with all the comfort of knowing my lover loves me and is here by my
side. I am so thankful God gave me the amazing husband He did. Like seriously.

But this story displays a significant weakness in my faith. Earlier in the day
when I sought comfort from the Lord, why was I not listening to His wisdom tell
me the same thing? And why was the knowledge that my heavenly lover loves me and
is here by my side not enough to stem my flow of tears? I pray that my faith
grows strong enough to feel that same comfort sooner in the day.

Oh, and to top it all off, and rehydrate me from my crying, my husband has
introduced me to mixing limeade and lemonade to create the most refreshing drink
of all time. Proof that God is good? I think yes.
