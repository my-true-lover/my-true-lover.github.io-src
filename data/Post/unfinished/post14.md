You know how people can tell you about something, but you never fully understand until it actually happens to you? Picky toddlers are one of those things. 

For the longest time, Job just ate anything and everything and I just had to keep up as best I could. Now he'd rather feed goldfish crackers to Wilbur because its funny. I don't know why its funny, but sometime in the last month my baby became a man-child suspect of any and all things that I'm trying to feed him because its probably vegetables which means its probably green, and he prefers Little Blue Truck to Green Eggs and Ham despite it being a literary classic with a very good point about trying foods before declaring that you'll never eat them.

But parenting isn't just about teaching, its also about learning: learning to try weird things, like combining carrots and salsa, a mom-approved Job original because its a full serving of vegetables that Job will actually eat. I guess theres still more that Green Eggs and Ham can teach me, like don't be afraid to mix it up. Although I think I'll draw the line at eating Carrots and Salsa with a fox.
