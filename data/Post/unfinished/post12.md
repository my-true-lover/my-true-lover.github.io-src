Courage in the face of pain with no guarantee that the pain will stop.

Oddly specific, I know, but that is the trait I admire most in others and occasionally myself. My Dad just started chemo, he is still the same super optimistic Dad I've always had, and I'm proud of him. My cousin is battling infertility with grace, and I adore her. All the writers who still call themselves writers in the face of a mountain of rejection letters-- I admire you. The husbands and fathers who quietly return to tough or boring jobs day after day to support their families-- I admire you. Everyone who can relate to Job in the Bible-- I admire you so much I named my son after you.
