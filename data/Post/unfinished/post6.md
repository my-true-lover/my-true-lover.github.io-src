Merry (Late) Christmas to everyone!

Job finally got his first tooth a couple days before Christmas, so we sang that all he wanted was his two front teeth. He still only has one, but I think Job was pretty happy with his first Christmas anyway.

We had a blast this year with just the three of us, letting Job pick out which present to open next and help unwrap all of them. Our cup runneth over with getting to watch our little baby very seriously and methodically open presents from all those who love us so.
