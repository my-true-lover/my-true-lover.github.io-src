What does wilderness mean for us? What role does the wilderness play in our lives? It's a place for us to feel lost, to wander when it turns out the body of Christ is not ready for all that He--our betrothed--has promised us yet. But it's also a place for prophets, for preparing the way of the Lord. A place to bring us to repentance, a place where we are baptized.

In my own life, it's a place to disconnect, and reconnect. To rest, hobby, exercise, feel the sun and enjoy creation. Thankfully, I have little experience with the desert, I much prefer lakes and mountains. But I think the mountains, the lakes, wherever we can still find some semblance of wilderness, is still a place of preparation. We can stop moving long enough to repent there. We ccan refocus on what matters and seek God's molding of our hearts to do His will. We can re-enter God's plan through the wilderness.
