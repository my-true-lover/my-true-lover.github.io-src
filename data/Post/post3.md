Sometimes it's weird to be a stay at home mom. In college, it was my job to
think about problems and brainstorm solutions. Now it's my job to love, protect,
and teach this baby. My life is more full and more fun, but there's a weird
sense of disconnectedness from the rest of our planet now. My thoughts barely
leave these few square miles where my two favorite people and our local church reside, until someone reminds me with the seemingly innocent question: "Who are you going to vote for?"

Come November, I don't know what I'll do. I'm leaning towards writing in
"Jesus," because He's the only one that can or will love, protect, and teach
my baby with me. 

In reading to Job, I came across Helen Keller's summation of the American voting
process: "Our democracy is but a name. We vote? What does that mean? It means we
choose between two bodies of real, though not avowed, autocrats. We choose
between Tweedledum and Tweedledee...‚Äù

So maybe this election isn't truly the worst set of options America has ever had
before. Obviously it's been pretty bad for a long time, and this is just more
history repeating itself. Jesus has always
sustained us throughout history, so repetitive history should be a  pretty
comforting process by now.
